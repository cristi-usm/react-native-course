/**
 * Clicks that evaporate once a lesson is past.
 *
 * A lecture wants `v-click`: the class sees one idea at a time and cannot read
 * ahead. An archived lesson wants the opposite — a student revisiting lesson 3
 * in week 9 should see the whole slide at once, not press Space through it.
 *
 * So the clicks are written once, in the deck, and REMOVED from the markdown
 * for every deck that is not `THEME_CONFIG.currentLesson`. This runs as a
 * Slidev markdown transformer, i.e. before Vue ever compiles the slide, which
 * matters: hiding clicked content with CSS would leave the click COUNT intact,
 * so a slide with five reveals would still swallow five presses of Space and
 * lie in the progress bar. Removing the directives from the source means the
 * archived deck genuinely has zero click steps.
 *
 * It is therefore a build/dev-time switch. Advancing `currentLesson` in
 * common/theme/config.ts and restarting is what freezes a lesson into its flat
 * form — same shape as everything else here, where lessons.json and config.ts
 * are read once and the decks fall out of them.
 *
 * Override for a quick check without touching config:
 *
 *   RN_CLICKS=keep  pnpm dev:03-io   # force clicks on  (preview the lecture)
 *   RN_CLICKS=strip pnpm dev:01-intro # force clicks off (preview the archive)
 *
 * What is stripped: the `v-click` / `v-clicks` / `v-after` attributes, and the
 * `<v-click>` / `<v-clicks>` wrapper tags (their contents stay). Matches inside
 * fenced code blocks are left alone, so a slide may show `v-click` as an
 * example. `v-mark` is NOT touched — it is a decoration, not a reveal, and its
 * own `at=` would need separate care.
